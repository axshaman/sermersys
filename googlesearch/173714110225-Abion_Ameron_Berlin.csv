Rooms are spacious and quiet.
Weakness: Room maintenance is not up to expectations. Customer service was poor - from booking to check-in, to issue reporting, we had to repeat our requests a few times to make sure that they were taken care of. I felt that the money paid to the room did not worth it.
Until the quality of customer service is improved, I would not recommend my friends or relatives to this hotel."
